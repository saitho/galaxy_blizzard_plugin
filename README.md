## Note on playtime

Currently we only support displaying the total playtime of your quickplay matches in Overwatch. Playtime might take some time to update after you quit the game.

**Important:** Make sure your Overwatch profile is set to public in order to show your playtime.
To do that, start up Overwatch and navigate to the Options. From there click the "Social" tab and toggle the option "Career Profile Visibility" to "Public".
